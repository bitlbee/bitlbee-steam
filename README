The Steam protocol plugin for bitlbee. This plugin uses the Steam Mobile
API allowing it to run alongside the main Steam client. It is worth
noting that the Steam Mobile API is HTTP based, which does lead to mild
latency.

Building and Installing:
  Make sure bitlbee and its headers have been installed. If bitlbee came
  from the distribution's repository, it will most likely need the
  development package, usually bitlbee-dev.

  If bitlbee was built by hand (or alike via a script), ensure the make
  target `install-dev` is invoked. This target is not called by default,
  and will install the headers that are needed.

  Do *not* use the source tree headers unless you know what you are
  doing. This can lead to mismatched header versions, which often times
  will lead to bad things.

  $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-steam.git
  $ cd bitlbee-steam

  With a "global" (or system) bitlbee installation:
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ make install

  Or with a "local" bitlbee installation (location: $HOME/bitlbee):
    $ export BITLBEE_CFLAGS="-I$HOME/bitlbee/include/bitlbee"
    $ export BITLBEE_LIBS=""
    $ ./autogen.sh --libdir=$HOME/bitlbee/lib
    $ make
    $ make install

Usage:
  Before continuing, please note, any account which is a "Limited User
  Account" will not work with this plugin. These limited accounts have
  many features negated from them, which are required for this plugin
  to function correctly as a chat client. Please, do not file issues in
  the tracker if your account is a limited account.

  See: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663

  Getting started:
    > account add steam <username> <password>
    > account <acc> on

  Authenticating with SteamGuard:
    > account <acc> set authcode <code>

  Captcha interaction may be required:
    > account <acc> set captcha <text>

  Output game play statues to the account channel(s):
    > account <acc> set game_status true

Debugging:
  Before debugging can begin, the plugin must be compiled with debugging
  support. Once debugging support has been enabled, one of the two
  supported environment variables can be defined to enable debugging
  output. This can be used in unison with debuggers such as GDB, which
  should enable easier tracing of bugs.

  When posting to the issue tracker, please ensure any sensitive
  information has been stripped.

  Enable debugging support (modify the build instructions above):
    $ ./autogen.sh --enable-debug

  Enable debugging output:
    For bitlbee and the plugin:
      $ export BITLBEE_DEBUG=1
      OR
      $ BITLBEE_DEBUG=1 gdb ...

    For just the plugin:
      $ export BITLBEE_DEBUG_STEAM=1
      OR
      $ BITLBEE_DEBUG_STEAM=1 gdb ...

  Obtaining a GDB backtrace:
    $ gdb \
        -ex 'handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass' \
        -ex 'break g_log' -ex run -ex bt \
        --args /usr/sbin/bitlbee -Dnvc /etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf
